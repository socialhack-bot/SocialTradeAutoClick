# SocialTradeAutoClick

## -- How to Use the script --

- Open the browser and login to social trade.
- Go to the clicks page.
- Click F12 key or right click on the page and select "inspector" option.
- Every browser has a different name like "inspector" or "inspect element" etc. Apply some common sense to select this option.
- A window will open below, go to the console tab on that window.
- Open the Autoclick.js file in browser. Otherwise you can download it on your computer and open it in notepad.
- Select all and copy the full script.
- Past the script in the browser's console window and enter.
- That's it, just lay back and rest while the script will run and do you work.


## NOTE:
- Tested on Chrome, Firefox only.
- Before running the script, make sure that popup's are allowed for social trade website. Otherwise the script will fail.
- In case the site is down or slow, in that case the script keeps waiting for the next click to get enabled. In that case, close the console window and refresh the page. Do the above steps again.
- Keep visiting the link as new improvements to the script will come.
- In case you have any problems, write an email to "socialhack.bot@gmail.com". But do not be sure that a resolution of the problem will be provided as this is not a support service.
